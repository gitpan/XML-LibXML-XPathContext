Revision history for Perl module XML::LibXML::XPathContext.

0.02 Fri Apr  4 2003

* Added missing include xpathInternals.h what fixes problems with
float numbers used in xpath expressions on platforms where PV is not
defined as double.

* XML::LibXML::XPathContext objects can be created without specifying
a current node now. I.e. new()'s parameter $node is optional now.

0.01 Thu Mar 27 2003

* First version based on XML::LibXML and XML::XSLT code.
